`<span>` elements define an inline section in a document.
`<div>` elements define a block secion in a document.

_Semantic_ elements have names that clearly identify the purpose of the content around which they are wrapped (i.e. `<table>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, or `<figure>`).

_Non-semantic_ elements have names that do not imply their purpose (i.e. `<span>` or `<div>`).
